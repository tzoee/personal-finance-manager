fix: Cloud sync now reads/writes from localStorage instead of IndexedDB

Root cause: Stores persist data to localStorage, but cloudSync was reading from IndexedDB (Dexie) which was empty.

Changes:
- cloudSync.ts now reads from localStorage keys (pfm_transactions, pfm_categories, etc.)
- cloudSync.ts now writes to localStorage when loading from cloud
- Removed dependency on storageService.exportAllData() which used IndexedDB
- Added helper functions getLocalStorageData() and setLocalStorageData()

This fixes the issue where data was not syncing between devices because auto-sync was saving empty data to cloud.
