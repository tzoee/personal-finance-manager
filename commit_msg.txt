feat: redesign Wishlist to single-screen list layout

- Replace card grid with compact list rows
- Minimal header with inline progress badge
- Each item shows: priority dot, name, progress bar, amount, actions
- Fixed height container with internal scroll
- Summary footer with totals
- Fits entire UI in one screen on mobile without scrolling
