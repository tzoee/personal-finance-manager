fix: make WishlistForm submit button always visible on mobile

- Modal slides up from bottom on mobile (items-end)
- Sticky footer with Batal/Tambah buttons always visible
- Compact form layout with side-by-side fields
- Removed note field to reduce form height
- Smaller text sizes and reduced spacing
- max-h-[85vh] ensures modal doesn't cover entire screen
